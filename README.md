This is a fork of Terry Cavanagh's flippy platformer game named VVVVVV that's focused on adding more tools for custom levels to use. We focus exclusively on the C++ version of the game. We make sure to always keep up with upstream.

The original repository for VVVVVV is located at [TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV).

The features that this version includes, along with a list of who has contributed, is located in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

Most of our discussion is concentrated in [the VVVVVV Discord server](https://discord.gg/Zf7Nzea).

[Terry Cavanagh has granted us an exception to VVVVVV's custom license](https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV/blob/master/License%20exceptions.md), letting us distribute our fork with `data.zip` included, provided we do not distribute any of the original main game levels.
